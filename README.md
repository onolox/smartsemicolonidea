# Smart Semicolon iDEA
An extension that makes semicolon smart!

No more boring manually go to the end of the line and type ;

You just have to type ; anywhere in the line and it will be put in the end of the line for you. But if you don't want to put it in the end just type backspace immediately after ; and it will be put in the actual position of the carret.

This works similar to the function present in the Eclipse IDE.
